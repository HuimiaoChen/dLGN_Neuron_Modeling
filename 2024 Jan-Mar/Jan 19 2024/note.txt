TrainRoom_1 new nonnegativeWeights for CL075_230228
  - modelWeights_with_sigmoid
    - train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_offset (newest for old protocol - 3-run data)
    - train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_onset (newest for old protocol - 3-run data)
       (the above two are same with different parameter settings.
       both add the settings of where to select data for training)

TrainRoom_2 new nonnegativeWeights for CL090_230515
  - modelWeights_with_sigmoid
    - train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_offset (newest for old protocol - 3-run data)
    - train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_onset (newest for old protocol - 3-run data)
       (the above two are same with different parameter settings.
       both add the settings of where to select data for training)

TrainRoom_3 new nonnegativeWeights for CL096_231018's old protocol data
  - modelWeights_with_sigmoid
    - train_with_data_randomly_selected (normal version, not newest but newer vesion than the next two)
    - train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_offset
    - train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_onset
    - train_with_data_randomly_selected (basedline reduction) (newest for old protocol - 2-run data)
    Note:
    (1) The first three are same with different parameter settings.
    Both add the settings of where to select data for training.
    (2) train_with_data_randomly_selected is newer than the other two, 
    because it updates the code for plotting in section 
    "Functions: read and plot structure data".
    (3) train_with_data_randomly_selected (basedline reduction) is the newest one with 
    update of adding high-pass filter for basedline reduction of signal traces.
    (4) Code of train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_offset and train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_onset 
    is with some changes for 2-run data, adapted from the code in TrainRoom_1 and TrainRoom_2 that is for 3-run data.
    This also means that code in TrainRoom_1 and TrainRoom_2 is without update of plotting in section 
    "Functions: read and plot structure data" and high-pass filter for basedline reduction of signal traces.

TrainRoom_4 new file with data processing hyperparameters modified for new data CL096_231018 
  - modelWeights_with_sigmoid
    adding train_with_data_ending_near_stimuli_onset/offset

TrainRoom_5 file for cross-dataset (cross runs) testing of models of a cell
  - FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified_OldProtocol.ipynb (newest for old protocol)
    This code is copied and revised from the file 
    "TrainRoom_3/modelWeights_with_sigmoid/train_with_data_randomly_selected (basedline reduction)/FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified.ipynb"
  - FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified_NewProtocol(old).ipynb (deprecated, use the newest one)
    This code is copied and revised from the file 
    "TrainRoom_4/modelWeights_with_sigmoid/FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified_NewData.ipynb"
  - FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified_NewProtocol.ipynb (newest for new protocol)
    This code is copied and revised from the file 
    "TrainRoom_6/modelWeights_with_sigmoid/FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified_NewData.ipynb"
  Note:
  (1) Code here is used for test, like testing the model trained on run 2 data with run 3 and run 4 data of the same cell.
  So, code for traning will not be run.
  (3) "FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified_NewProtocol.ipynb" is with setting of whether to use the high-pass 
  filter. FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion_Simplified_NewProtocol(old).ipynb isn't with that function.

TrainRoom_6 update of code in TrainRoom_4 (newest for new data protocol, run 2 of CL096_231018)
  - modelWeights_with_sigmoid
    adding high-pass filter for basedline reduction of signal traces.
