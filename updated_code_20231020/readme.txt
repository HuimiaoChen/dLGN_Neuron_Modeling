FluoData_Fitting_plus_v3_LocalVersion.ipynb is an update of FluoData_Fitting_plus_v2.ipynb in the folder "all_code_20230905".

Why is it named "LocalVersion"?
Because the original version is run on Google Colab, the local version is for local running, like on personal computer or server. The difference is slight: (1) the root path is different; (2) some commented code for downloading file from cloud is not eligible in the local version.

Many things are updated in the v3 version, inlcluding but not limited to (1) more figures are plotted; (2) more organized structure; (3) improved model and training; (4) more features are analyzed; etc.

I may update where are the key cell chunks in the .ipynb file for change the parameters for different trials.
